# Running the Experiments

To run the experiments we need to set some environment variables first.

```console
export D2L_PATH=<path_to_root_of_d2l>
export PYTHONPATH=<path_to_root_of_d2l>/src
```

where d2l is located in learner/d2l
Then to run an experiment by executing the corresponding bash script.
Note: the submit_ scripts will only work on the
Tetralith Supercomputer at Link√∂ping University.
